## FOOD4ME

### App Description
FOOD4ME plans meals and grocery lists based on what ingredients you currently have and with intentions on making a nutritious balanced meal. Users can plan what groceries to buy, where, and for what dishes.

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile:
    The user will also have the option to use the camera feature in order to image scan different food-related items in their home instead of manually entering them. By using their location, the user will be able to find the nearest grocery stores around them. A scale in which the User can manage how many people they will be serving will also be implemented. 
- Story:
    FOOD4ME will allow the user to manually enter food items that they have in their kitchen in order to generate recepies with set items. In our case, as college students, our friends and peers would love an app that could instantly create recepies with the food items located in their dorm/apartment. 
- Market:
    Any person can use this app. They can make purchases to get access to premium features. Grocery stores can purchase licenses to be featured on this app.
- Habit:
    FOOD4ME can be used on a daily basis, possibly more than once a day. Depending on the items in the user's kitchen and daily consumption, the FOOD4ME app could be used an avergae of 3 times a day or more.
- Scope:
    v1 - will be able to make recipes from a given list of ingredients through scanning. Recipe correlation will help identify which recipes are more available. Filter recipes by scale needed and correlation allowed. Gives nutrition information.
    v2 - in addition will be able to connect and compare local grocery store pricings for further needed ingredients.
